# ðŸ¤– VoliBot
The new automated League client.

VoliBot is based on [Mimic](http://mimic.molenzwiebel.xyz/desktop), which allows us to call direct League Client API calls.

This repository contains the source code for the new VoliBot. [Looking for the download instead?](http://volibot.com/)

## Developing VoliBot

Mimic is composed of three different components: **web**, **conduit** and **rift**, but VoliBot only uses the conduit component.

## License

VoliBut is released under the [MIT](https://github.com/Maufeat/VoliBot/blob/master/LICENSE) license. Feel free to browse through the code as you like, and if you end up making any improvements or changes, please do not hesitate to make a pull request.
